# Portfolio
This is my first attempt at making a responsive portfolio using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  On the home page, you can find links to my social media accounts, github, etc.  On the about tab, you can find a short paragraph about myself.  The contact tab will contain a form to send contact information to me.  Finally, the portfolio tab will contain future projects made by me.
